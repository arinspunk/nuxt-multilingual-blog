# Nuxt Multilingual Blog 

This is an example of a basic multilingual blog with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) + [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) and [nuxt/i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/). The objective of the project is to create a functional basic structure with:

1.  A home where to show the published posts
2.  The posts themselves
3.  And a menu to change the language

So everything is quite spartan, like its styles for example, but it works :grimacing:

## How to run this (and to test it :microscope:) ##

First you need to have [Node installed in your computer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and then:

1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) this repository.

2.  Clone your forked repository.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/nuxt-multilingual-blog.git
    ```

3.  Go to the project and install npm.

    ```sh
    cd nuxt-multilingual-blog/
    npm install
    ```

4.  Run a node server working in your local machine.

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

Now your site is running at `http://localhost:3000` :v:

## How it works
